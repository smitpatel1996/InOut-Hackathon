Real time sign language to sign language  Translator

## Problem statement

According to Wikipedia, there are about 300 sign languages around the world & infact, there is no actual statistics or study on the number of languages. In fact, in countries like SriLanka & Tanzania, almost all schools for the mute have their own language. Given this, it makes it difficult for hearing & speech impaired people to interact or visit a place with a new sign languge. Looking at it from this angle, people haven't been including the impaired when we overcome our language barriers using softwares like Google Transalte.

## Solution

We have decided to pick up this problem statement and see how we can add inclusion & diversity to language tools. After 30 hours of intense hardwork, we have ended with an application, which traslates a real time sign language signs to another sign language. For the duration of the hackathon we have translated American Sign Language to Indian Sign Language.
